## What's this?

The SuperNoclip is an addon meant as a way to travel at high speed across truly big maps with almost no issues. This was made specically for infinite maps, whose sizes are far from being reached in a life or more.

The vanilla noclip is not really suitable for this task, since it has a speed limit and its very buggy when trying to go at high speed (like the connection problems). The superNoclip, instead, allows to easily fly without issues through the map.

## How to Use

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to reset all your noclip console settings (sv_noclipspeed as example), besides this addon still uses some basis, its useless with this addon.

- Enable the SuperNoclip mode by typing `infmap_supernoclip_enable 1` in console. The mode is disabled by default.
- Add some value to the noclip speed by using the `Ã¬nfmap_supernoclip_speedmultipler"` convar. Once that, fly as usual. Adjust the value as needed.

## Warning: this system has no prediction due to how it works!!! meaning while in multiplayer, a high ping may affect completely the usage of this. Make sure to use it only in singleplayer or stable multiplayer connections!
