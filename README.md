## What's this?

The SuperNoclip is an addon meant as a way to travel at high speed across truly big maps with almost no issues. This was made specifically for [infinite maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2905327911), whose sizes are far from being reached in a human life or more.

The GMOD noclip is not really suitable for this task, since it has a speed limit (means its slow) and its very buggy when trying to go at high speed (like connection problems). The superNoclip, instead, allows to easily fly without issues through any map. Just imagine to travel through the entire [Alexandrovich's multiverse in 5 seconds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3132262723)!

## How to Use

> [!NOTE]
> First, make sure to reset all your noclip console settings (sv_noclipspeed as example), besides this addon still uses some basis, its useless with this addon.

- Enable the SuperNoclip mode by typing `infmap_supernoclip_enable 1` in console. The mode is disabled by default.
- Add some value to the noclip speed by using the `Ã¬nfmap_supernoclip_speedmultipler"` convar. Once that, use noclip as usual. Modify the value as needed.
